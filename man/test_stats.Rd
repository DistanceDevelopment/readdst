\title{Test to see if Distance for Windows and R get the same results}
\usage{
test_stats(analysis, statuses = 1, tolerance = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{analysis}{a converted (but not run) analysis}

\item{statuses}{for which statuses should tests be run? See "Status", below (Defaults to \code{1}: analysis that ran without error or warning in Distance for Windows).}

\item{tolerance}{the tolerance of the test (default 0.01)}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} with five columns: \code{Statistic}, a description of the tested statistic; \code{Distance_value} the value of the statistic stored by Distance for Windows; \code{mrds_value} the value of the statistic calculated by \code{mrds}; \code{Difference} the proportional difference between the previous two columns (computed using \code{\link{all.equal}}); \code{Pass} a series of ticks, indicating that the value in the \code{Difference} column is less than \code{tolerance}.
}
\description{
Tests the results stored in the Distance for Windows project file against those generated from running the same analysis in R.
}
\details{
A previous call to \code{\link{convert_project}} will return a list of projects. Only one analysis at a time can be run with \code{test_stats}. If you wish to run all the analyses in the project, you can use \code{\link{lapply}}.
}
\note{
Tests all available statistics.
}
\section{Status}{

The \code{status} code is taken from Distance for Windows to indicate whether the analysis has been run yet and what the outcome was. Status codes are as follows:

\itemize{
  \item{\code{0}}{ analyses has not been run in Distance for Windows yet}
  \item{\code{1}}{ analysis ran without errors or warnings}
  \item{\code{2}}{ analysis ran with warnings}
  \item{\code{3}}{ analysis ran with errors}
}

If an analysis has a status of 0 or 3 there will usually not be any statistics attached to the analysis, so no tests will be run.

Note that an analysis that runs with error in Distance for Windows may run fine in R and an analysis that runs fine in Distance for Windows may not work in R. In the latter case, please consider submitting this a a bug to \url{github.com/distancedevelopment/distance-bugs}.
